# Resistor Parallel Solver
An over complicated resistor paralleling solver (for me to play with python). It find a solution to odd resistor values by paralleling resistors.

# Data set file
All data set file must use extension .resistor. All data set file must be located at the same
location of the python scrip. Multiple data set can be used, the script will just find a solution
on all the data set.

# python version
Developed and tested with python 3.7.x
